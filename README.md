## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app

* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[N/A. I did not use any outside resources to help complete my submission.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A challenge I encountered in creating this submission was debugging the code. Towards the end of the pre-work assessment, I tested my code for issues and found that their were plenty to be discovered. There is no sequence or patterns being displayed, and my sound will not work for some reason. After the start button is clicked, the only butto that will light up is the blue button. I have observed and checked over both my work and the instructions, but fell short at finding a solution. Unfortunately, I was not able to overcome this obstacle, but I have spent a lot of time on this assessment and can't let it go to waste. I hate to submit subpar work, but the deadline is super close. However, if given the opportunity, I can submit an app that I have coded on my own to replace this assessment.  ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I currently have no questions about web development.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would first debug it. As stated earlier, I fell short of debugging the program which is a huge disappointment in itself. Honestly, if I had the time, I would most likely start from scratch and go through the code with a fine-toothed comb. After debugging the program, I would add optional features to make the memory game more fun and more original. I am very disappointed in the outcome and product of the hours spent at my laptop, but if I had more time I am positive my mistakes would be corrected.  ]
